#This script extracts required Global Burden of Disease data from the zip files
#by first extracting zip-files, then reading csv file, adding required data to combined dataframe
#and finally deleiting extracted files. Resulting dataframe is then saved as csv-file.

#Defining folder where the data is (stored externally in my dropbox as the GBD files are large)
