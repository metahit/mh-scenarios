# PMSLT 
The proportional multi-state life table (PMSLT) is a macro simulation method to do comparative risk assessment of changes in health risk factors on health burden.  In the ITHIM-R project, the PMSLT is an alternative to the ITHIM simulation approach, that allows for projections of changes in burden of diseases over time and time lags for changes in exposure and changes in health outcomes. The data needs, however, are high.
